            Iâ€™m an aspiring web developer, currently searching for a frontend
            position that will continue to push and challenge me. I am adaptable
            and always eager to learn, and would love to find a position where I
            can continue growing and strengthening my skills. Over the past
            year, I have been doing consultancy work as a Teaching Assistant for
            the Ironhack Full Stack Web Dev bootcamp. This position has been has
            been both challenging and rewarding. It has given me the opportunity
            to increase and advance my knowledge in both front and backend web
            development. However, I am ready to challenge myself further, and
            take the next step to find a long term position in a company as a
            frontend developer.
