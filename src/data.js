    quote:
      "During his time as a Teaching Assistant, Jaime demonstrated a strong commitment to his students and their success. He was always available to answer questions and provide feedback, and his teaching style was clear and easy to understand. He was quick to know when and which errors popped up when students were encountering issues. And of course, Jaime's approachable and friendly personality. It absolutely made him a favorite among his students. His positive attitude and encouragement helped to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment where everyone felt comfortable and engaged, not to mention he can manage pressure or a heavy environment easily (absolutely taught me a thing or two there). Overall, I highly recommend Jaime as a web developer. His technical knowledge, teaching skills and approachable demeanor make him an invaluable asset to any web development team or teaching position.",
